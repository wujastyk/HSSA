# HSSA-journal-LaTeX-stylesheet
maintenance site for the LaTeX stylesheet for History of Science in South Asia (https://hssa-journal.org)

The most important files here are 

* hssa.cls
* hssa.sty

These two contain the formatting instructions for the journal's articles.  They call the other files, like

* hssa-biblatex.sty
* hssa-indexing.sty
* hssa-reledmac.sty  (for two-column footnotes and for critical editions)

The file 

* hssa-documentation.dtx

is the driver file for formatting and printing the documentation for users and hackers (see the output PDF).

To do:

Make a separate, much simpler file for authors.
